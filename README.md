# Sales-Analysis

This sales analysis has been automated by pulling data from a csv file into a program that performs a quick analysis of the sales and visitors data for a farm stand and a mobile market.

If the user inputs "Farm Market", it will filter and provide an analysis for the farm market in specific.

First, it will display the farm sales analysis.

Second, it will ask the user if they would like to view the data for farm stand visitors. If the user inputs "yes", it will repeat a similar process to the sales analysis.

Third, it will ask the user if they would like to view the average of all of the sales. If the user inputs "yes", the program will display the average in the terminal.

If the user inputs "Mobile Market" instead of "Farm Market", the program will perform a similar process to the process described above, and these are the results.
